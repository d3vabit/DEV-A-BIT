Description
The basic idea behind rose from the online classes of batch K20, as the college is the place where senior guidance is really important, it was hard for us to find our ideal seniors to look up for as there are so many people with so many skills out in the college, things were pretty difficult to get the right direction. So we plan on building a personal community platform exclusively for BITM students where they can make there profiles, share/link their achievements and projects, their contact information(email, Ph etc.) so the coming batches can easily look up for the perfect senior with the specific skill for their guidance which will save them a ton of time, also(if becomes popular) can be used as portfolio for on-campus placements, which would help companies realize how students stack up against each other.

So we plan to break this project into three major components:-
1. The Design-
We plan on taking this step seriously as more the captivating and easy to use the platform is more will be the engagement and usage of it. also structure of this will be really important
2. The frontend-
No matter how good the design is, it needs to be built correctly and intelligently.
3. The Dev-a-Bit rating-
rating will be based on the skills and achievements of the individual and will be given by Admins Solely.
4. Open Source Proposition-
Dev-a-Bit proposes students to contribute so that its up-to-date and never becomes bygone, allowance of the change is to be again made by admins. 
4. DBMS(for future)
We all know the data is everything and as this platform expands we would really like to work brains on its management in future.
This all will hopefully result in a platform that not only reduces the senior-junior gap but also instill a confidence in the mind of the students that they have something to be proud of, that is their Dev-a-Bit Rating.

Project Timeline
Week-1- This week will be mostly brainstorming the design and frontend part to ensure the UI/UX flow is sweetest possible.
Week-2- In week 2 we plan on wrapping up the looks of the platform.
week-3- In this week we plan on working on the smaller features needed to be implemented.
Week-4- We will spend this week to focus more on refining the platforms and bug testing things to make them as smooth as possible for display.
